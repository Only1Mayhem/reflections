	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do I need to do it?
This creates a new set of files that you would potentially like Git to monitor.
It allows me to track new files for changes and backups.


	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It allows me to consider which files to add or reset before I commit - for this particular portion of the code. It keeps the log clear of unnecessary files that I may have added and then decided against.


	How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can compare the staging are to the working dir or the latest commit to be sure that the correct file/s have been added - i.e. one commit per logical change
