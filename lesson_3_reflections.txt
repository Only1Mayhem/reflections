	When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with others. Or for backup purposes.

	Why might you want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
	your remote repository?
In case of conflicts... I'm actually not too sure. If I am working on a file and so is someone else - if 
it auto-pulls then my file may be overwritten with theirs. I doubt that is the case, actually. So, if my 
file isn't overwritten, then there will be a conflict when I push - Comme ci, comme Ã§a.
