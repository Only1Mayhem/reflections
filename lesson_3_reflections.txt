	When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with others. Or for backup purposes.

	Why might you want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
	your remote repository?
In case of conflicts... I'm actually not too sure. If I am working on a file and so is someone else - if 
it auto-pulls then my file may be overwritten with theirs. I doubt that is the case, actually. So, if my 
file isn't overwritten, then there will be a conflict when I push - Comme ci, comme Ã§a.

	Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?
Fork: clone of repo on Github - used when I am able to use repo but cannot change the original.
Clone: identical version of my Github repo on my local (or local to local). Used to work on my local or
online - and for collaborators on my version.
Branch: identical version of code (at that point in time or commit) on local - copies to Github, but not
created there. Used when I want to try something in my code on one of my repos, but I do not want that
change to affect the main, "procution ready", version.
